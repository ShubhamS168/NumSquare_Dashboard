    <h2>Welcome to the Data Analysis Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates how to build a web-based data analysis tool using Flask, SQLite, and Matplotlib. 
        You can input numbers, compute their squares, store results in a database, and visualize them as a chart.
    </p>
    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <p>
        Enter a number below and click "Calculate" to compute its square. 
        The result will be stored in the database. 
        You can view all results on the "View Results" page and visualize them on the "View Chart" page.
    </p>
    <form action="/square" method="post">
        <input type="number" name="num" placeholder="Enter a number" required>
        <button type="submit">Calculate</button>
    </form>
